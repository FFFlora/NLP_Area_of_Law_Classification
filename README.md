# NLP Task: Text Classification   

This project is a NLP task for an online interview assignment.

Main idea of this project:

The dataset contains ~1000 legal text files and 900 of them are labeled with the area of law ( i.e., `LNIND_1993_DEL_112`  has been labeled as `Criminal Laws` ), the goal is to predict the rest of the 100 files with the correct area of laws. 

Still in progress to achieve higher accuracy. 

## Introduction

#### In this project I accomplished the following things:

- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction and evaluation
- Model selection, training, and result comparason 
- Setup pipeline and hyperparameter tuning 



------

#### Process:

###### Text Preprocessing

Tools/Libraries used: `NLTK` 

Used `WordNetLemmatizer ` to do lemmatization



------



#### Conclusion(s)/Discussion.

##### In Progress:

- Topic Modeling(specifically for legal documents)
- Wordcloud 
- Visualization and analysis 

#### Appendix:

- Technical descriptions of (unusual) statistical procedures

- Detailed tables or computer output

- Figures that were not central to the arguments presented in the body of the report
